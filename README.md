# Login-SignUp-Mail-Verification
The project is created by Tanishq Singh using the Python programming language.

# Key features:
- Data is stored using a combination of lists and dictionaries, and this data is dumped into a binary file.

- The program simulates an imaginary platform called "TANISHQ ACCOUNTS," where users can sign up or log in to their accounts.

- The program presents two options to users: log in or sign up.

- During the sign-up process, several checks are performed, such as ensuring that the user ID being created does not already exist and that the password provided is alphanumeric.

- When users attempt to log in, various checks are carried out, including verifying whether the user exists and whether the password is correct.

- A notable feature of the program is the creation of a separate module for sending emails. An OTP (One-Time Password) is generated using the random module and sent to the user's email address.

- Successful login or sign-up only occurs if the entered OTP matches the one sent to the user's email.

- This program combines user authentication, data storage, and email verification to create a secure user account management system.
