# Login-Signup-with-Mail-Verification
This project is created by Tanishq Singh, using python language.
Here, data is stored by using a combination of list and dictionary and those data are dumped into binary file.
As the program starts, user are welcomed in TANISHQ ACCOUNTS that's an imaginary platform created where user can Sign up or login into their account.
Programs displays two options log in or sign up. When user sign up then, few things are always checked and ensured by this program such as user ID that they are creating must not already exists, password should be alpha numeric only. When they login again few things are checked like user exists or not, if exists then password is correct or not and so on.
The best thing about this program is that a separate module is being created in this project for sending mail, whenever user login or sign up an OTP is generated using random module, sent to email id of the user if OTP matches then only successful login or sign takes place.
This is how my program looks like.
